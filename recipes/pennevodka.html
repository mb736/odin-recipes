    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>We get it: homemade pasta sauce requires a bit more effort than picking up that trusty jar, but trust us—with this vodka sauce, it makes all the difference. Ready in around 30 minutes, this penne alla vodka is one of our go-to pasta dinners when we're looking for an easy-to-make recipe that greatly delivers on flavor and comfort. After trying and testing this recipe again and again to perfect the creamy, bright sauce that coats each and every noodle, we’ve finally cracked the code on the best-ever vodka sauce. Trust us—it’s the best we’ve ever had (and worth making double).</p>
