    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p> Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff). </p>
    
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1</strong> Egg</li>
        <li><strong>1 and a half</strong> cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><strong>3 and a half</strong> teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li><strong>A quarter</strong> teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li><strong>1 and a quarter</strong> cups milk</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong> tablespoons butter melted</li>
      </ul>
   
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      
    <ol>
      <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth. </li>
      <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter. </li>
    </ol>
